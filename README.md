## Introduction

The DeepSTPP model is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting events in spatiotemporal contexts. By incorporating the Mamba State Space Model, this version enhances the model's ability to capture complex patterns in data that vary over space and time. 

The model is particularly useful in fields such as urban planning, epidemiology, and environmental science, where understanding the dynamics of events in space and time is crucial.

## Features

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Hawkes Process Integration**: Models self-exciting point processes for better event prediction.
- **Mamba State Space Model**: Enhances state estimation and prediction accuracy.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks**: Leverages RNNs for capturing long-term dependencies in data.
- **Spatiotemporal Analysis**: Supports analysis of data that varies across both space and time.
- **Structured State Space Models**: Offers flexibility in modeling complex relationships.

## Installation

To install the DeepSTPP with MambaSSM, clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidxnis/DeepSTPP-with-MambaSSM.git
cd DeepSTPP-with-MambaSSM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. 

## Usage

After installation, you can run the model using the following command:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml
```
